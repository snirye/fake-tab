# Icon Placeholders

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software. The icons should:
- Have a transparent background
- Be simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Represent the "fake tab" or "theater mask" theme (ðŸŽ­)
- Use consistent colors and style

## Suggested Design
- Use a theater mask (ðŸŽ­) or tab icon
- Colors: Use the extension's gradient colors (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Style: Modern, minimal, friendly

## Temporary Solution
Until proper icons are created, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files as placeholders.
